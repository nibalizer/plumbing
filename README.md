# plumbing

This module contains utility scripts for voxpupuli admins to
do various management tasks.



# travis secrets

To generate the list of encrypted blobs for puppet forge deployment:

./bin/puppet_encrypt_for_travis.sh $forge_password > share/puppet_travis_secrets

To generate the list of encrypted blobs for rubygems deployment:

./bin/rubygems_encrypt_for_travis.sh $rubygems_api_key > share/rubygems_travis_secrets


# Setting up a gem for rubygems deploys

Add the voxpupuli rubygems account to the owners list of the gem.


```
gem owner <gemname> -a krum.spencer+voxpupuli@gmail.com
```


# gpg

to decrypt:


gpg -d puppet_credentials.asc > puppet_credentials


to encrypt:


gpg -a -e -s $(for human in $(cat recipients.txt); do echo "-r ${human}"; done) puppet_credentials


# syncing labels

Syncing labels can be done by using github-label-sync. The labels.json file
contains the labels to be synced

To sync a repository:

npm install -g github-label-sync
github-label-sync -a <GitHub token> <repository>

You can use -d for a dryrun to see what will be added and removed.


# Syntax Validation

We use https://github.com/caarlos0/shell-ci-build as a submodule in travis. This enables shellcheck and validates all \*,sh files. We probably should update it from time to time.
